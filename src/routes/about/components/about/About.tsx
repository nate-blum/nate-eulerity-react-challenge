                        Hello! I’m Nathan Mintos, a determined and resourceful autodidact pursuing a double major in
                        Computer Science and Linguistics and a minor in Philosophy in the Rutgers University SAS Honors
                        Program. I have a strong passion for computers, language, logic, and above all learning. Nothing
                        is more important to me than learning from others and teaching myself, and making an effort to
                        use what I learn to educate others. I am fully fluent (reading as well as writing) in Hebrew, as
                        well as English. When I'm not coding or pursuing my academic passions, I can probably be found
                        at the gym, where my current personal records include a 380lb deadlift, 325lb squat, and 230lb
                        bench press.

                    <AboutMeP>
                        In 9th grade I taught myself to code in Java, and since then I’ve accumulated significant
                        experience with full-stack development, data science, and computer hardware, with 5 years of
                        experience working remotely and in-person during my summers for Flip.to, a Florida-based
                        hospitality marketing startup. As part of the 8-member development team, I gained comprehensive
                        expertise with Javascript and its various libraries, as well as mature collaboration skills from
                        interactions with my knowledgeable senior colleagues, and specific development experience within
                        the Ad Tech space. Throughout my tenure at Flip.to, I used my self-starting skills extensively
                        to research new technologies for inclusion in the codebase, which in turn helped me to create
                        thorough documentation for use in training. I’ve never been scared of asking questions, and
                        quickly learned advanced troubleshooting and bug fixing skills through the help of my teammates.
                        At all times I worked closely with my colleagues in the development team, the creative/design
                        team, the account executives, and the administration, in order to ensure that my projects were
                        perfectly in-line with the evolving nature of the company’s needs.

                        I am extremely excited for this opportunity to apply my previous experience to this new context
                        at Eulerity, and I highly appreciate you and the entire Eulerity team for taking the time to
                        consider my application. Please don't hesitate to contact me at the following:
